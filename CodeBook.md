##Description
The script run_analysis.R performs the 5 steps described in the course project's definition.
Training and test data is selected on the basis of the features of interest and column bound.  Then the two data sets are row bound.
Then the activity data is substituted with a meaningful activity name.
Finally, a new dataset with average measures for each subject and activity type (30 subjects * 6 activities = 180 rows) is generated.
The output is put into a file (tidy.txt), and provided in this repository.

##Identifiers
subject - The ID of the test subject
activity - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken
